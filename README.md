Observable Trends:
According to the data we've obtained for Heroes of Pymoli, it is safe to assume the following:
1) The majority of the players who spend money on the game is male.

2) Although males are more often to purchase in-game items, it may be more profittable to advertise towards females since they tend to spend more money per purchase.

3) A "sale" of the items "Final Critic" and "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" would likely catch the attention of the player base since it's the most popular item bought. Adding it to a bundle would be successful.
